🚀 Databricks Basics
This README provides a quick introduction to Databricks, its core concepts, and how to get started with basic workflows.


📖 What is Databricks?
Databricks is a cloud‑based data platform built on Apache Spark. It enables:
- Big data processing and analytics
- Machine learning and AI workflows
- Collaborative development with notebooks
- Integration with multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)

⚙️ Key Concepts
- Workspace → Your collaborative environment for notebooks, clusters, jobs, and data.
- Cluster → A set of compute resources (VMs) used to run Spark jobs.
- Notebook → Interactive environment for writing code (Python, SQL, R, Scala).
- Jobs → Scheduled or triggered tasks that run notebooks or workflows.
- Delta Lake → Storage layer that brings ACID transactions to big data.

📊 Typical Workflow
- Ingest data → Load from cloud storage, databases, or APIs.
- Transform data → Use Spark SQL or PySpark for ETL.
- Store data → Save in Delta Lake for reliability.
- Analyze data → Build dashboards or run ML models.
- Automate jobs → Schedule pipelines with Databricks Jobs.
